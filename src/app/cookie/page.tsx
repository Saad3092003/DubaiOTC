                  Browser cookies are text files with small pieces of data
                  downloaded onto your computer or mobile device. Browser
                  cookies and other similar technologies (collectively called
                  “Cookies” in this Cookies Policy) enable websites and apps to
                  store information or facilitate access to information stored
                  on your device to enable certain features and distinguish you
                  from other visitors. These technologies are used by most
                  website and app providers to let users navigate between pages
                  efficiently, ensure security of the webpage or application,
                  understand how their websites are used, remember user
                  preferences and generally improve the user experience. More

                  www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org. Cookies set
                  by the website operator are called &quot;first party
                  cookies&quot; and cookies set by parties other than the
                  website operator are called &quot;third party cookies”. You
                  should check the third-party&apos;s website for more

                    Strictly Necessary Cookies are essential for our Services to
                    function and therefore cannot be switched off. They are
                    usually only set in response to actions made by you which
                    amount to a request for services, such as setting your
                    privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. These
                    also include cookies we may rely on for security purposes,
                    such as to prevent unauthorized access attempts. You can set
                    your browser to block or alert you about these cookies at
                    any time, but some features of our Services may not work.

                    We use these Cookies to count visits and traffic sources so
                    we can measure and improve the performance of our Services.
                    They help us to know which pages are the most and least
                    popular and see how visitors move around the Sites and Apps,
                    and to resolve any errors that occur on the Services quickly
                    to provide you with a better experience. For example,
                    Cookies like our third party JSESSIONID cookie are used to
                    provide analytics on how our Apps perform. This cookie lasts

                    your preferences. For example, our first party
